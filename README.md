# Godot-4.0-Day-Night-cycle

## Not yet finished


## System

- Created for Godot version: v4.0-beta3_linux.x86_64
- Uses the default PhysiscalSkyMaterial for the skybox
- Can be used for custom shaders as well if they depend on the directional light in a similar way than the PhysiscalSkyMaterial

## Script

- It is basically just a simple script rotating the DirectionalLight3D in the same manner as our sun.
- It has a latitude and a longitude parameter that you can adjust to your liking
- The same could also be archived with an animation player but the coded version enables simple direct access to all values.
